2. Download code to your local machine.
3. Open gams_data_processing.ipynb in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and main.gms in GAMS Studio.
4. Change fault length and microgrid size as desired in Jupter Notebook and in main.gms (battery size must be changed in main.gms)
5. Run all cells in Jupter Notebook
